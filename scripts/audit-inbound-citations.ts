/**
 * Inbound citation audit — the direction no repo's own audit covers.
 *
 * 🔴 A citation audit checks the citations a repo OWNS, pointing OUTWARD.
 * **Nothing checks citations pointing IN.** So a rename or deletion here leaves
 * this repo's audit green — correctly, it repointed everything it owns — while
 * sibling repos that cite the old path go RED, and their pre-commit and pre-push
 * break for every session in those checkouts.
 *
 * **The repo whose gate breaks is never the repo whose commit broke it.** The
 * author gets no signal, and the victim has no reason to suspect a rename
 * elsewhere.
 *
 * Measured 2026-09-05, from ONE rename: `manager` relocating its unit suite from
 * `src/**‍/__tests__/` to `tests/` left **11 broken citations in this repo and 2
 * in `core`** — both gates red, found hours apart by two sessions arriving at a
 * blocked commit. Manager's own audit was green throughout. Inbound counts at
 * that moment: api-cloudrun 423, core 292, manager 203, templates 55.
 *
 * ⚠️ **CI can never catch this class**, which is why it is a local gate: each
 * workflow checks out ONE repo, so a sibling citation resolves to nothing and
 * reports UNVERIFIABLE rather than BROKEN. A green CI run is not evidence.
 *
 * ⭐ **Three states, not two.** Fewer than two sibling repos present reports
 * SKIPPED and exits 0 — never "0 broken". A lone-repo checkout is legitimate and
 * must not fail, but a check that could not run must never read as one that
 * passed, which is the same trap this whole guard is about.
 *
 * ⚠️ **This file is deliberately byte-identical across `manager`,
 * `api-cloudrun`, `core` and `templates` except for ONE line — the
 * `@cfs/core/utils/citations` import, which `core` takes relatively because it
 * IS core.** A `diff` between any two copies should show only that. The rules
 * themselves are shared rather than re-implemented; this workspace has already
 * paid for the same walk existing in three places and needing the same repair
 * three times. Consolidating the whole script into `@cfs/core` is the natural
 * next step and wants a publish, so it did not happen here.
 *
 * 🔴 **In `templates` this is MANUAL, and that is the gap.** This repo has no git
 * hooks by design — its branches are user-generated drafts, exempt from hygiene —
 * and CI cannot run this because each workflow checks out one repo. So nothing
 * runs it automatically. 42 citations point into `templates/`, which means a
 * rename here CAN break sibling gates and nothing here will say so.
 *
 * **Run `deno task lint:citations:inbound` before pushing any rename, move or
 * deletion.** Adding it to a workflow would be worse than not having it: the
 * check would report SKIPPED on every run and read as a passing step.
 *
 * Usage:  deno task lint:citations:inbound   (or the raw form below)
 *         deno run --allow-read scripts/audit-inbound-citations.ts [--verbose]
 * Exit:   0 clean or skipped · 1 collapsed corpus · 2 broken inbound citations.
